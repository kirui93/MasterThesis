### About the folder and the docs in it
This folder contains all the codes that I used in my master thesis

This folder contains three R-markdown documents and a Python file. The Rmarkdown files are for calculating correlations and auto-correlations of the assets, Markowitz model with and without risk-free asset and integrated formulation model with and without a risk-free asset. I decided to use Jupyter notebook for the Entropic Value-at-Risk based model since there are nice packages in Python to handle non-linear optimization problems which depend on more than one variables.
